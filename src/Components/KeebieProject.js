            <p>A hobby that i recently got in to was the art of building keyboards. One thing that I couldn't find online was one website with the information of switches from
              all kinds of brands. I decided to build one for myself and other keyboard enthusists who may find this website useful.</p><br></br>
            <span className='modal-title'>Technologies Used</span><br></br>
            <img id='mern-img' src={mernImg}></img><br></br>
            <p>This website was build using the MERN (Mongodb, Express, React.js, Node.js) stack. I implemented Redux to manage the application state, as the state had to change
              after retreiving from the database. </p>
            <span className='modal-title'>Notes</span>
            <p>Overall this was a fun side-project to create, giving me a better understanding of how redux works, and how useful it is after it has been implemented.
              This was my first project using mongodb, which I found simple to get started with.
